This bot is also capable of being an excellent moderation bot for all needs. Multiple commands such as kick, ban, mute are available at your disposition. ModerationBot automatically unmutes users after their mute is over, AND will prevent mute evasion (users leaving and rejoining to lose their Muted role).
